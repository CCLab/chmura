** Database

The core of the statistics is the word database. It consists of following
tables (Django data models):

 # Lemma (table: word_lemma)

This is the canonical form of the word, as it will be displayed in
statistics and all of the actual speech words will point to it.

 -- in case of nouns, it should be the nominative article, singular form
    (mianownik liczby pojedy≈Ñczej)

 -- verbs should be in the infinitive form

 -- for adjectives it is best to be stored in indefinite third person
    neutral gender form

 # Word (table: word_word)

This is the actual word taken from a speech. It has following properties
(columns):

  -- prev/next - pointers (ForeignKeys) to previous/next Word of the speech
     (double linked list)

  -- lemma - pointer to Lemma of the word

  -- word - clean (lowercase, punctuation stripped) form of the word

  -- display - actual form of the word in speech text with punctuation and
     uppercase letters

  -- speech - pointer to Speech object describing the speech that the word
     belongs to.

It is possible to have a few copies of a single speech in the word database,
but it will break all the statistics count. To prevent this the loader
script will try to delete all the word objects that point to speech it is
loading before the process starts. Due to limitations in the Django ORM, the
process may fail, it is then necessary to delete the data from SQL console
by hand

 # Dict

This is a dictionary that maps clean words (word.word) to lemmas.

  -- word - clean form of the word for lookup

  -- lemma - pointer to lemma of the word


 # Ignore

Ignore list, lemmas that are linked in that table will be skipped from the
display.

 # Stat

This is a cache of word counts in speeches. It needs to be refreshed (by
triggering 'chmura.word.views.cache' view after any change to the word
database.
